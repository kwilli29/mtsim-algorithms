# mtsim-algorithms

serial_driver: Runs all the serial files to generate an edgelist, construct a graph, build a list of roots to start at, and run a specified amount of BFS and SSSP searches from the roots

mtsim_driver: Runs all the paralle files to generate an edgelist, construct a graph, build a list of roots to start at, and run a specified amount of BFS and SSSP searches from the roots using the mtsim functions in an attempt to simulate MT behavior
