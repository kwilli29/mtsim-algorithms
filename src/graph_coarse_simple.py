def maximal_matching(G): # networkx greedy function
    r"""Find a maximal matching in the graph.

    A matching is a subset of edges in which no node occurs more than once.
    A maximal matching cannot add more edges and still be a matching.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        Undirected graph

    Returns
    -------
    matching : set
        A maximal matching of the graph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)])
    >>> sorted(nx.maximal_matching(G))
    [(1, 2), (3, 5)]

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm greedily selects a maximal matching M of the graph G
    (i.e. no superset of M exists). It runs in $O(|E|)$ time.
